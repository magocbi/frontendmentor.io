## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A bit more about flex layout. Using space-between to make sure buttons stay at the bottom regardless of text.

### Continued development

Responsive and JS.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33887051/prevent-flex-items-from-stretching) - This helped me make button stop stretching and align it to the left at the same time.
